        "A Bagging classifier is an **ensemble meta-estimator** that **fits** **base classifiers** each on **random subsets** of the original dataset and then **aggregate** their individual **predictions** (*either* by voting or by averaging) to form a **final prediction**. Such a meta-estimator can typically be used as a way ***to reduce the variance*** of a black-box estimator (e.g., a decision tree), by introducing randomization into its construction procedure and then making an ensemble out of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Bagging is used with **decision trees**, where it significantly raises the stability of models in the **reduction** of **variance** and **improving accuracy**, which **eliminates** the challenge of **overfitting**. Bagging in ensemble machine learning takes several weak models, aggregating the predictions to select the best prediction.\n",

        "$\\Rightarrow$ Decision trees are sensitive to the specific data on which they are trained. If the training data is changed (e.g. a tree is trained on a subset of the training data) the resulting decision tree can be quite different and in turn the predictions can be quite different.\n",

        "Let’s assume we have a sample dataset of `1000` instances `(x)` and we are using the `CART algorithm`. Bagging of the CART algorithm would work as follows.\n",

        "\n",
        ">When bagging with decision trees, we are less concerned about individual trees overfitting the training data. For this reason and for efficiency, the individual decision trees are grown deep (e.g. few training samples at each leaf-node of the tree) and the trees are not pruned. *These trees will have both high variance and low bias*. These are important characteristics of sub-models when combining predictions using bagging.\n",
        "\n",
        ">The only parameters when bagging decision trees is the number of samples and hence the number of trees to include. This can be chosen by increasing the number of trees on run after run until the accuracy begins to stop showing improvement (e.g. on a cross validation test harness). Very large numbers of models may take a long time to prepare, but will not overfit the training data.\n",
