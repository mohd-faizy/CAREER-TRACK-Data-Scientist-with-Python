    Who I Am
    Read
    my "King's
    Day Speech" for some inspiration.
    
    I am the author of the Python
    programming language.  See also my resume
    and my publications list, a brief bio, assorted writings, presentations and interviews (all about Python), some
    pictures of me,
    my new blog, and
    my old
    blog on Artima.com.  I am
    @gvanrossum on Twitter.
    
    I am retired, working on personal projects (and maybe a book).
    I have worked for Dropbox, Google, Elemental Security, Zope
    Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA.  (See
    my resume.)  I created Python while at CWI.
    
    How to Reach Me
    You can send email for me to guido (at) python.org.
    I read everything sent there, but I receive too much email to respond
    to everything.
    
    My Name
    My name often poses difficulties for Americans.
    
    Pronunciation: in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
    pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
    sound clip.)  However, if you're
    American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
    too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
    have. :-)
    
    Spelling: my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it
    that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
    Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
    first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
    last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
    example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."
    
    Alphabetization: in America, I show up in the alphabet under
    "V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
    me under "G" in their address book...

    Here's a collection of essays relating to Python
    that I've written, including the foreword I wrote for Mark Lutz' book
    "Programming Python".
    I own the official 
    Python license.
    
    The Audio File Formats FAQ
    I was the original creator and maintainer of the Audio File Formats
    FAQ.  It is now maintained by Chris Bagwell
    at http://www.cnpbagwell.com/audio-faq.  And here is a link to
    SOX, to which I contributed
    some early code.
