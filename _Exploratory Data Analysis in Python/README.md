# Exploratory Data Analysis in Python

How do we get from data to answers? Exploratory data analysis is a process for  exploring  datasets, 
answering questions, and visualizing results. This course presents the tools you need to  clean  and 
validate data, to visualize distributions and relationships between variables, and to use regression 
models to predict and explain. You'll explore data related to demographics and health, including the 
National Survey of Family Growth and the General Social Survey. But the methods you learn  apply  to 
all areas of science, engineering, and business. You'll use Pandas, a powerful library  for  working 
with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and  SciPy,  StatsModels  for  regression, 
and Matplotlib for visualization. With these tools and skills, you will be prepared to work with real 
data, make discoveries, and present compelling results.
