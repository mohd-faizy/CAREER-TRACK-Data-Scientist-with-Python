TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>\n<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>\n<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>\n<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_684/img/left_shark.jpg\" alt=\"Left Shark Steals The Show\">\n<em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/huntleypaton/16464994135/in/photostream/\">Left Shark Steals The Show</a>.

Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?\n<p>The vast majority of Super Bowls are close games. Makes sense. Both teams are likely to be deserving if they've made it this far. The closest game ever was when the Buffalo Bills lost to the New York Giants by 1 point in 1991, which was  best remembered for Scott Norwood's last-second missed field goal attempt that went <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPFZCGgjDSg\">wide right</a></em>, kicking off four Bills Super Bowl losses in a row. Poor Scott. The biggest point discrepancy ever was 45 points (!) where Hall of Famer Joe Montana's led the San Francisco 49ers to victory in 1990, one year before the closest game ever.</p>\n<p>I remember watching the Seahawks crush the Broncos by 35 points (43-8) in 2014, which was a boring experience in my opinion. The game was never really close. I'm pretty sure we changed the channel at the end of the third quarter. Let's combine our game data and TV to see if this is a universal phenomenon. Do large point differences translate to lost viewers?

It's important to note that the duration of the halftime show is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have.
