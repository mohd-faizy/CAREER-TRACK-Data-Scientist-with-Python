05 - Slicing index values:

Slicing lets you select consecutive elements of an object using first:last
syntax. DataFrames can be sliced by index values or by row/column number; we'll
start with the first case. This involves slicing inside the .loc[] method.

Compared to slicing lists, there are a few things to remember.

You can only slice an index if the index is sorted (using .sort_index()).
To slice at the outer level, first and last can be strings.
To slice at inner levels, first and last should be tuples.
If you pass a single slice to .loc[], it will slice the rows.

pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures_ind has country and city in the index, and is available.

Instructions:

- Sort the index of temperatures_ind.

- Use slicing with .loc[] to get these subsets:
  
  - from Pakistan to Russia.
  
  - from Lahore to Moscow. (This will return nonsense.)
  
  - from Pakistan, Lahore to Russia, Moscow.
